# GestureOS
Human beings interact with a lot of things around them. One such interaction 
happens between humans and computers. As the technology and software are 
becoming complex day-by-day, the modes of interaction with computers are 
also varying. One of the mode can be using different gestures produced by your 
hand while sitting in front of your webcam. 

# Methodologies

Steps and methodology followed while implementing/building the project :

i.    To recognise only hand from the feed receiving through webcam is the 
      most important part as this project is based on hand gesture. Mediapipe 
      library of python is used for the hand recognition.
      
ii.   Dataset got prepared by clicking several photos of each gesture. 

iii.  This Dataset is then used to prepare the model using different algorithms. 

iv.   Model got tested against the testing data to find the best model among 
      others. 
      
v.    We try to integrate our model with our operating system using different 
      libraries. 
      
"Google Colab is use for data preparation, data training as well as for data testing".
